##How it works

This code creates a WebCamTexture() for each webcams, on two planes, for the left eye and for the right one. 


##Set up

* Connect two identicals webcams

* Press play in the Unity editor

###Extra informations

For a nice result, don't hesitate to take some times to calibrate the webcams on the Oculus.

Sometimes you need to invert (physicaly) the webcams to fit them in the oculus rift. To do that, you just have to enable  *Rotate plane* boolean.
